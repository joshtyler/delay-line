\chapter{Folder Structure} \label{sec:folder-struct}

The project is structured as a single repository using the git version control system. For those unfamiliar with git, the project folder may be treated as an ordinary computer folder, however there exists inside the root of the directory a hidden folder, \texttt{.git}, which contains the entire history of the project. This history is not of use to a user only interested in the latest state of the project, but is useful to find files or parts of files which may have been deleted. An example of such files are the project files for the Lattice and Xilinx toolchains, which were later replaced in the project by the open-source IceStorm toolchain.

The philosophy of the project repository is that it should not contain any:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Files not directly related to the project itself (e.g. reference material)
	\item Auxillary files automatically generated by tools
	\item Binary files that may be easily regenerated by tools
\end{itemize}
but should contain:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Design files
	\item Project files/configuration files used by tools
	\item Documentation files, even if they may be re-generated (e.g. \LaTeX generated \texttt{.pdf} files), provided they are not excessively bulky.
\end{itemize}
This philosophy is enforced inside the repository using \texttt{.gitignore} files.


The structure of each sub-folder in the project repository is shown in the diagram below.
